git init
git init is used to create an empty repository in the folder where you have started Git bash.
 

git status
This command will show you what is on the stage and what is not. It will tell you if it was modified, deleted, ext. 
 

git add
git add .   – this command will add every file in the repository to the stage. Instead of . you can type in the file name after the dot to specify which one you want to add.
This shows the files that were added using git status:

 


git commit
git commit is used to put all the files in the staging area into a node. This node should have a note which is done by adding -m “note” after the git commit command.
