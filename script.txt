git init
git init is used to create an empty repository in the folder where you have started Git bash.
 

git status
This command will show you what is on the stage and what is not. It will tell you if it was modified, deleted, ext. 
 

git add
git add .   – this command will add every file in the repository to the stage. Instead of . you can type in the file name after the dot to specify which one you want to add.
This shows the files that were added using git status:

 


git commit
git commit is used to put all the files in the staging area into a node. This node should have a note which is done by adding -m “note” after the git commit command.

 


git push
git push puts nodes done by commit into the online repository. The command is: git push -u origin master – master is the name of our default branch which is the one we want to push.

 

git remote
git remote – list repositories on remote server.
git remote add <name> <url> - creates a new remote repository.
 

Git branch
Git branch newBranchName : Creates a new branch in the local 
repository.
git branch –a / -l / -r : Lists branches in repositor
 

git checkout
 Command: git checkout branch_name
Makes this node the current Head
It won't work if there are modified files.
Use –f to discard non committed files. 
 

git merge
git merge branch_name - This will merge the named branch with the current branch.  
(this is an example of trying to merge when they are the same)
